# Decentralized Learning Management System (LMS)

## Vision

The **Decentralized Learning Management System (LMS)** aims to create a transparent and trustless platform for online education. By leveraging blockchain technology, this LMS allows instructors to create and offer courses, while students can enroll and pay for these courses directly. The system ensures that payments are securely transferred to instructors and that course enrollment and completion are verifiable on the blockchain.

## Flowchart

The following flowchart illustrates the basic interactions within the Decentralized LMS:

1. **Instructor Creates Course**
   - Input: Course title, description, cost
   - Output: Course ID and details stored on the blockchain

2. **Student Enrolls in Course**
   - Input: Course ID and payment
   - Output: Enrollment status updated, payment transferred to instructor

3. **Student Completes Course**
   - Input: Course ID
   - Output: Course completion event emitted

4. **View Course Details**
   - Input: Course ID
   - Output: Course details displayed

## Contract Address

The contract address for the deployed `DecentralizedLMS` smart contract on the Ethereum network will be provided after deployment. For testing purposes, you can deploy the contract on a test network like Rinkeby or Goerli.

## Future Scope

- **Certification System**: Implement a certification mechanism for course completion.
- **Course Rating and Reviews**: Allow students to rate and review courses, providing feedback to instructors.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Introduce a governance model to allow stakeholders to vote on major changes or features.
- **Enhanced Payment Options**: Support multiple payment tokens and cryptocurrencies beyond Ether.
- **Interactive Learning**: Integrate features for quizzes, assignments, and interactive learning modules.
